You are Codex operating in `ree-v2`.

Goal: execute this week's approved proposals and emit contract-compliant Experiment Packs.

Required work items:
- `EXP-0020` / `ARC-018` / `claim_probe_arc_018`
- `EXP-0021` / `Q-007` / `claim_probe_q_007`
- `EXP-0022` / `MECH-033` / `claim_probe_mech_033`
- `EXP-0023` / `ARC-007` / `claim_probe_arc_007`
- `EXP-0024` / `MECH-059` / `jepa_uncertainty_channels`
- `EXP-0025` / `Q-018` / `claim_probe_q_018`

Contract to follow exactly:
- `evidence/experiments/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`

Acceptance checks per proposal:
- At least 2 additional runs with distinct seeds.
- Experiment Pack validates against v1 schema.
- Result links to claim_ids_tested and updates matrix direction counts.

Output required:
- concise run table: run_id, seed, status, key metrics, evidence_direction
- list of generated run pack paths
```
