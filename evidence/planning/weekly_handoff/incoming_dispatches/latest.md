You are Codex operating in `ree-v2`.

Goal: execute this week's approved proposals and emit contract-compliant Experiment Packs.

Required work items:
- `EXP-0015` / `ARC-018` / `claim_probe_arc_018` (mode=discriminative_pair)
- `EXP-0016` / `Q-007` / `claim_probe_q_007` (mode=discriminative_pair)
- `EXP-0017` / `MECH-033` / `claim_probe_mech_033` (mode=discriminative_pair)
- `EXP-0018` / `ARC-007` / `claim_probe_arc_007` (mode=discriminative_pair)
- `EXP-0019` / `MECH-056` / `trajectory_integrity` (mode=discriminative_pair)
- `EXP-0020` / `MECH-059` / `claim_probe_mech_059` (mode=discriminative_pair)
- `EXP-0021` / `ARC-016` / `claim_probe_arc_016` (mode=targeted_probe)
- `EXP-0022` / `MECH-025` / `claim_probe_mech_025` (mode=targeted_probe)

Contract to follow exactly:
- `evidence/experiments/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`

Epoch tagging requirements:
- Stamp every new run `manifest.json` with `"architecture_epoch": "ree_hybrid_guardrails_v1"`.
- Keep `timestamp_utc` aligned with the current epoch window (`>= 2026-02-15T15:31:31Z`).

Acceptance checks per proposal:
- Use discriminative pairs (primary vs explicit ablation/control), not broad profile sweeps.
- Use matched shared seeds across pair conditions and pre-register thresholds before execution.
- At least 2 additional runs with distinct seeds unless stricter pair checks are specified in proposal acceptance checks.
- Experiment Pack validates against v1 schema.
- Each emitted manifest includes `architecture_epoch=ree_hybrid_guardrails_v1`.
- Result links to claim_ids_tested and updates matrix direction counts.

Output required:
- concise run table: run_id, seed, status, key metrics, evidence_direction
- list of generated run pack paths
```
