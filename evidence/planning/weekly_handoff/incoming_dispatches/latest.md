You are Codex operating in `ree-v2`.

Goal: execute this week's approved proposals and emit contract-compliant Experiment Packs.

Required work items:
- `EXP-0001` / `ARC-003` / `claim_probe_arc_003`
- `EXP-0002` / `ARC-005` / `claim_probe_arc_005`
- `EXP-0003` / `ARC-007` / `claim_probe_arc_007`
- `EXP-0004` / `ARC-018` / `claim_probe_arc_018`
- `EXP-0006` / `IMPL-022` / `claim_probe_impl_022`
- `EXP-0007` / `MECH-033` / `claim_probe_mech_033`
- `EXP-0009` / `MECH-040` / `claim_probe_mech_040`
- `EXP-0011` / `MECH-046` / `claim_probe_mech_046`

Contract to follow exactly:
- `evidence/experiments/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`

Acceptance checks per proposal:
- At least 2 additional runs with distinct seeds.
- Experiment Pack validates against v1 schema.
- Result links to claim_ids_tested and updates matrix direction counts.

Output required:
- concise run table: run_id, seed, status, key metrics, evidence_direction
- list of generated run pack paths
```
